### Success of project



1.  we learned how to work as a team. 

   Actually, all of us do not an experience of full-stack development. But we are the guys who have great desires for knowledge and ambitions to build up a nice product. In design phase,  we change our directions many times, from developing  a intelligent housekeeper to driving simulation to final version, a smart parking lot management system. After deciding what we want to do, we kept working on how to achieve it, including the functionalities we need, the communication protocols, and the data structures. All of us participant into the whole process and know what we want and how should we do all the time. That is one of the reason why we can deliver a pretty satisfied production. In addition, we are full of motivation to help each other when someone meets challenge he/she cannot handle, and this property allows our tasks go as plan. During the whole process, we never fight alone. 

   Most importantly, I want to say :

   happy 520, and happy everyday my teammates.



2. We learned how to get a quick start for a development of unfamiliar language 

   In IoT side,  M5 series of product and Arduino were fresh for us. In desktop application, we never used processing before and in web side, we are freshmen to develop web page. Although all of them are new to us, we overcome them by frequent chatting, working hard and guide from tutors. This project taught us how to get a start from zero to one.   



### Future work

MQTT connection is less-effort and unstable and we did not use a high-performance relational database  . If we really want to make our product launched to market, we need to improve the communication methods and build up a relational database to store our users' information.
