### Success of the project
在这里写主要的成就和**学到了什么（这一点非常重要！）**
#### Iot
#### Web
#### Desktop
* Front end

* Back end

<a name="future"></a>

### Future work
在这里写如果这个产品日后用于商业用途，还有什么功能可以加。

There are many features to be added in order for this product to launch
for public use. 

#### Iot
比如车辆进入到stack蓝牙可以detect的区域时，stick屏幕提示“检测到杆”这样。
#### Web
比如可以在网站上实时附近（支持这个系统的）停车场有多少空位。database可以转移到网上。
#### Desktop
* Admin account page\
In the top left corner we have included a button for the access to
the manager/admin's account. This means every staff using this application
needs to log in to make sure they have the rights to use this application.
This will then induce a login screen before this main application page.
In the manager/admin's account page there will be information such as 
their work phone number, how many hours have they worked/used this 
application, and a link to submit tickets should there be any technical
issues, the records of the customer issues they have helped to solve, etc.

* Customer account page\
Admins should have the rights to access any customer's account, with 
confidential information hidden, of course. This is useful when customers
encounter technical issues, e.g. cannot top up, cannot see parking history,
cannot create account, cannot add vehicles etc. Under these circumustances, 
the admin/manager can access their account to complete those tasks for them,
or create an account for them. After completing those tasks, there should
be a record of it showing in the admin's account as their accomplishments. 

Ultimately and ideally, the M5Stick can be purchased along with the
car, so all new-generation cars can start using this system immediately.
Sooner or later, it can cover all the parking lots and all the cars registered
in the UK.

While the above is hard to achieve, something easier to expand this service
on is the drive-thru restaurants. The payment can be completed by the similar
method: Stick sends user information (no need for car's information this 
time, but because the Stick is kept in the car, this can be convenient for
drive-thru service), Stack at the restaurant detects the bluetooth and sends
the user information and payment amount to the broker, then desktop and web ends
can, respectively, charge the payment and records the user's activity.

### Working practices of the group


<a name="_coronavirus"></a>

### Coronavirus impact
This work has been impacted by the global pandemic COVID-19, as 3 out of 6
group members went back to China. The time lost greatly on not only
the long-haul flight but also: trying to constantly refresh airline pages
to get precious tickets that were cancelled by others, keeping an eye on 
the airline announcements on 
the flight status, queuing up for temperature tests after landing, and 
14-day isolation (some were even longer due to close-by passengers on the
flight tested positive) in a hotel that only offers basic facilities 
which means not ideal internet connection nor ideal hardware.

Besides that, the 7-hour time difference made communication harder in 2 ways:
1 We can only effectively communicate when we were all awake. 2 Only
the members remaining in the UK can participate in lecturers' video
meeting because the meetings were held after midnight in China.

Also, due to the censorship in mainland China, the group members have
had episodes of hard times to access github, which in return delayed development.
