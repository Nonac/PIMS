## Future work
在这里写如果这个产品日后用于商业用途，还有什么功能可以加。

There are many features to be added in order for this product to launch
for public use.

### Short-term goals

#### Iot
比如车辆进入到stack蓝牙可以detect的区域时，stick屏幕提示“检测到杆”这样。
如何让stack控制杆。Stick是不死要安装在车里的，丢了怎么补，数据怎么保护
#### Web
比如可以在网站上实时附近（支持这个系统的）停车场有多少空位。database可以转移到网上,这样
可以保护data privacy， 因为目前所有的user data都不保密，manager全都可以看到。
购买stick的页面。注销账户选项。
#### Desktop
* Admin account page\
In the top left corner we have included a button for the access to
the manager/admin's account. This means every staff using this application
needs to log in to make sure they have the rights to use this application.
This will then induce a login screen before this main application page.
In the manager/admin's account page there will be information such as 
their work phone number, how many hours have they worked/used this 
application, and a link to submit tickets should there be any technical
issues, the records of the customer issues they have helped to solve, etc.
不同的停车场需要有不同的total space count
* Customer account page\
Admins should have the rights to access any customer's account, with 
confidential information hidden, of course. This is useful when customers
encounter technical issues, e.g. cannot top up, cannot see parking history,
cannot create account, cannot add vehicles etc. Under these circumustances, 
the admin/manager can access their account to complete those tasks for them,
or create an account for them. After completing those tasks, there should
be a record of it showing in the admin's account as their accomplishments. 

### Long-term goals

Ultimately and ideally, the M5Stick can be purchased along with the
car, so all new-generation cars can start using this system immediately.
Sooner or later, it can cover all the parking lots and all the cars registered
in the UK.

While the above is hard to achieve, something easier to expand this service
on is the drive-thru restaurants. The payment can be completed by the similar
method: Stick sends user information (no need for car's information this 
time, but because the Stick is kept in the car, this can be convenient for
drive-thru service), Stack at the restaurant detects the bluetooth and sends
the user information and payment amount to the broker, then desktop and web ends
can, respectively, charge the payment and records the user's activity.

### Working practices of the group
#### Agile development

#### Daily communication
We mainly used Wechat, a Chinese main stream online chatting platform, to 
communicate on a daily basis. Everyone has been very friendly and respective
 to others and reachable. Wechat supports unlimited free group video and voice calls,
and offers stable internet connection in the UK and China. Thus, whenever we
needed clarifications that were harder to explain over messaging, we arrange
Wechat voice calls, which saves the tariff that would have occurred on international phone calls.
During the first few project testing periods, we also used Wechat video/voice
 calls.
 
#### GitHub
We used GitHub for all the code development and file sharing, except for video recordings we
chose Google Drive because of their large sizes. We have 2 remote branches on
the repository: master and dev. Everyone developed their codes locally and
pushed them to dev branch. One group member was in charge of merging dev into 
master whenever our codes were sophiscated enough to be a release version.
That group member was also mainly in charge of creating issues and allocating
specific tasks on group members. Then the issues got closed when they were solved.

### Coronavirus impact
This work has been impacted by the global pandemic COVID-19, as 3 out of 6
group members went back to China. The time lost greatly on not only
the long-haul flight but also: trying to constantly refresh airline pages
to get precious tickets that might be cancelled by others, keeping an eye on 
the airline announcements on 
the flight status, queuing up for temperature tests after landing, and 
14-day isolation (some were even longer due to close-by passengers on the
flight tested positive) in a hotel that only offers basic facilities 
which means not ideal internet connection nor ideal hardware facilities.

Besides that, the 7-hour time difference made communication harder in 2 ways:
1 We could only effectively communicate when we were all awake. 2 Only
the members remaining in the UK could participate in lecturers' video
meeting because the meetings were held after midnight in China.

Also, due to the censorship in mainland China, the group members have
had episodes of hard times to access github, which in return delayed development.
