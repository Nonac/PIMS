## Future work
在这里写如果这个产品日后用于商业用途，还有什么功能可以加。

There are many features to be added in order for this product to launch for public use.

### Short-term goals

#### Iot
比如车辆进入到stack蓝牙可以detect的区域时，stick屏幕提示“检测到杆”这样。如何让stack控制杆。Stick是不死要安装在车里的，丢了怎么补，数据怎么保护
#### Web
比如可以在网站上实时附近（支持这个系统的）停车场有多少空位。database可以转移到网上,这样可以保护data privacy， 因为目前所有的user data都不保密，manager全都可以看到。购买stick的页面。注销账户选项。
#### Desktop
* Admin account page

In the top left corner we have included a button for the access to the manager/admin's account. This means every staff using this application needs to log in to make sure they have the rights to use this application. This will then induce a login screen before this main application page. In the manager/admin's account page there will be information such as their work phone number, how many hours have they worked/used this application, and a link to submit tickets should there be any technical
issues, the records of the customer issues they have helped to solve, etc.
不同的停车场需要有不同的total space count

* Customer account page

Admins should have the rights to access any customer's account, with confidential information hidden, of course. This is useful when customers encounter technical issues, e.g. cannot top up, cannot see parking history, cannot create account, cannot add vehicles etc. Under these circumstances, the admin/manager can access their account to complete those tasks for them, or create an account for them. After completing those tasks, there should be a record of it showing in the admin's account as their accomplishments. 

### Long-term goals

Ultimately and ideally, the M5Stick can be purchased along with the car, so all new-generation cars can start using this system immediately. Sooner or later, it can cover all the parking lots and all the cars registered
in the UK.

While the above is hard to achieve, something easier to expand this service on is the drive-thru restaurants. The payment can be completed by the similar method: Stick sends user information (no need for car's information this time, but because the Stick is kept in the car, this can be convenient for drive-thru service), Stack at the restaurant detects the Bluetooth and sends the user information and payment amount to the broker, then desktop and web ends can, respectively, charge the payment and records the user's activity.

### Working practices of the group
#### Agile development

#### Daily communication
We mainly used WeChat, a Chinese main stream online chatting platform, to communicate on a daily basis. Everyone has been very friendly and respective to others and reachable. WeChat supports unlimited free group video and voice calls, and offers stable internet connection in the UK and China. Thus, whenever we
needed clarifications that were harder to explain over messaging, we arrange WeChat voice calls, which saves the tariff that would have occurred on international phone calls. During the first few project testing periods, we also used WeChat video/voice calls.

#### GitHub
We used GitHub for all the code development and file sharing, except for video recordings we chose Google Drive because of their large sizes. We have 2 remote branches on the repository: master and dev. Everyone developed their codes locally and pushed them to dev branch. One group member was in charge of merging dev into master whenever our codes were sophisticated enough to be a release version. That group member was also mainly in charge of creating issues and allocating specific tasks on group members. Then the issues got closed when they were solved.

#### Self-reflection 
When we formed the group, we were not close friends as we are now. There were trust issues, disagreements, and doubts. With the project rolling on, we built up trust and functioned as one. We discovered each other's strengths - everyone has a unique strength that benefitted the project. 

Yinan - full of creative ideas, without him we would not have come up with this design.

Tao - IT genius,  just leave him with the M5Stack and M5Stick and he will come back with a complete implementation in a matter of days.

Fuzhou - his intelligent brain handled the entire website design and implementation all by himself in 5 days.

Hongjie - brilliant developer, just tell him what result we want and he will deliver well-functioning codes promptly.

Zhen - smart programmer. He and Hongjie wrote the core server controller that all other elements depend on.

Lea - 谁来帮我写一下

Outstanding front-end designer and team leader. Through her communication, every part of us is brought closer together. Excellent language and video editing skills made for an impressive team presentation.--from Yinan



Now it's the end of the project. Looking back on the past 3 months, not only did we gain knowledge from the lectures, workshops, and online resources, but also from each other. We talked through our own codes to each other and offered suggestions on techniques to use. We discuss frequently and figured out together how to collaborate under this disturbing situation. We have earned precious experience of group collaboration.

### Coronavirus impact
This work has been impacted by the global pandemic COVID-19, as 3 out of 6 group members went back to China. The time lost greatly on not only the long-haul flight but also: trying to constantly refresh airline pages to get precious tickets that might be cancelled by others, keeping an eye on the airline announcements on the flight status, queuing up for temperature tests after landing, and 14-day isolation (some were even longer due to close-by passengers on the flight tested positive) in a hotel that only offers basic facilities which means not ideal internet connection nor ideal hardware facilities.

Besides that, the 7-hour time difference made communication harder in 2 ways: 1 We could only effectively communicate when we were all awake. 2 Only the members remaining in the UK could participate in lecturers' video meeting because the meetings were held after midnight in China.

Also, due to the censorship in mainland China, the group members have had episodes of hard times to access github, which in return delayed development.

One other thing to mention is that due to the COVID-19 influence, the marking criteria changed to 100% dependent on the portfolio, which is not the top strength of our group. As a group of foreigners whose first language isn't English, it was a shame that we couldn't deliver the well-functioning product that we are proud of face to face, but to write it down. We needed twice or more time than others on the writing to make sure our language is clear and straight forward, because we feared that no matter how much effort we put in to produce this software, if we couldn't deliver it clearly in the report, which is the only chance we have, all the effort would be wasted.
