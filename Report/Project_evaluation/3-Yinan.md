# Project Evaluation

## Success of the project

### Desktop

* Front end

  Front-end engineering for desktop applications, like all view work, is a combination of fine art and dynamic technology. How to create a user interface that corresponds to the application scenario the user is in is the main thing we should consider. For example, we should consider what color patterns to apply under what circumstances, or what data visualization tools to use to achieve the best results under what circumstances. Thinking logic like this can be troubling, but it's also the core problem with the front-end view.

  The desktop app view framework we applied in this project is Processing's controlP5 repository. Of course, this is our best option for completing class requirements. Although we had several alternative options, it was the framing conditions that allowed us to adapt to similar work later. To develop the framework, the front-end working group fully read the developer documentation, including all the samples and even the source code of some repositories. We also found bugs in the sample architecture, which is why we stopped developing the controlP5 multi-page refresh.

  Of course, it's not just technology that we've learned. We also learned how to work as front-end engineers on large projects to interface with back-end engineering and flexibly adjust our projects and code as the back-end functions. This builds the foundation for us to contribute to the more significant work. This will serve us well in our future work.

  

## Future work

There are many features to be added in order for this product to launch for public use.

### Long-term goals

Ultimately and ideally, the M5Stick can be purchased along with the car, so all new-generation cars can start using this system immediately. Sooner or later, it can cover all the parking lots and all the cars registered in the UK.

While the above is hard to achieve, something easier to expand this service on is the drive-thru restaurants. The payment can be completed by the similar method: Stick sends user information (no need for car's information this time, but because the Stick is kept in the car, this can be convenient for drive-thru service), Stack at the restaurant detects the Bluetooth and sends the user information and payment amount to the broker, then desktop and web ends can, respectively, charge the payment and records the user's activity.
