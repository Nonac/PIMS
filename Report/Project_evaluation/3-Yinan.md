# Project Evaluation

## Success of the project

### Desktop

* Front end

  Front-end engineering for desktop applications, like all view work, is a combination of fine art and dynamic technology. How to create a user interface that corresponds to the application scenario the user is in is the main thing we should consider. For example, we should consider what color patterns to apply under what circumstances, or what data visualization tools to use to achieve the best results under what circumstances. Thinking logic like this can be troubling, but it's also the core problem with the front-end view.

  The desktop app view framework we applied in this project is Processing's controlP5 repository. Of course, this is our best option for completing class requirements. Although we had several alternative options, it was the framing conditions that allowed us to adapt to similar work later. To develop the framework, the front-end working group fully read the developer documentation, including all the samples and even the source code of some repositories. We also found bugs in the sample architecture, which is why we stopped developing the controlP5 multi-page refresh.

  Of course, it's not just technology that we've learned. We also learned how to work as front-end engineers on large projects to interface with back-end engineering and flexibly adjust our projects and code as the back-end functions. This builds the foundation for us to contribute to the more significant work. This will serve us well in our future work.

  

## Future work

There are many features to be added in order for this product to launch for public use.

### Long-term goals

Let's look to a greater future. With the development of IoT technology, people will no longer be satisfied with simple tracking of real objects, but to develop more human interaction with reality. The parking management system project developed in this project is a kind of car networking, the core of which lies in the interaction between M5StickC and M5Stack, in other words, the communication between key and door. If we continue to look forward to this project, then we can predict some pictures of the future. Ultimately and ideally, the M5Stick can be purchased along with the car, so all new-generation cars can start using this system immediately. Sooner or later, it can cover all the parking lots and all the cars registered in the UK. Then it won't be a dream for us to apply such a convenient device at any drive-in restaurant.

Then let's continue to think that in this project, KEY's interaction with DOOR relies on the Bluetooth technology that exists now. Of course, for security purposes, it is certainly not possible to use protocols that are so open for this project to be put into mass socialization. The project will then have the opportunity to advance the development and implementation of a proximity vehicle interaction encryption protocol. The advantages offered by proximity vehicle interaction encryption protocols are enormous compared to the identification technologies such as license plate, image and IC card radio frequency that exist today. The new wireless protocol is fundamentally different from the original technique in terms of both recognition accuracy and speed of recognition.

What if we think outside the vehicle of the "car"? Then we will get a door that can be opened from a distance, and through this door, we need to have tickets. By extension of this idea, we get office area management systems, amusement park management systems, cinema management systems and even import/export logistics management systems for ports. All in all, the system will be rich in extensions in the long-term, and all these extensions will make our lives more convenient.
