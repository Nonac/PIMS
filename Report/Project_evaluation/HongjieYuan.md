# Project Evaluation
#### Success of the project
**Desktop backend**

The project successfully communicated with M5Stack through the MQTT protocol. Even if the Processing side and the M5Stack side use different language development, data exchange through the Json format is also very good. We took into account the needs of the M5Stack part and the needs of the web part, and stored the data well and controlled the task logic. Desktop can accept M5Stack signals and make judgments on their status, and send signals to M5Stack at the same time.

We have never been exposed to the software Processing before, and we are very unfamiliar with the syntax. By reading the documentation of Processing, understanding the APIs provided by it, and then testing by the method of unit testing, we used the library functions provided by Processing well and completed the task. This task is also designed to communicate with the teammates in the group, but it is very troublesome to test with multiple people at the same time, so we used the MQTT client to manually build the required Json file to simulate the M5Stack message. In this way, everyone in the group can complete the entire system test independently.

**Future task**
In this project, for the process of opening and closing the car when the car enters the parking lot, we just set a time of 5 seconds to simulate the car entering. To make matters worse, we only used the delay (5000) API to block the system. At this time, if other messages came, the system could not receive it. So in the future we will use multithreading to receive signals, so that even if one thread is blocked, it will not affect other threads. At the same time, the control of opening the pole and entering the pole can not be a simple 5-second passing time, but should use intelligent identification to determine whether the car has successfully entered the parking lot, and then perform the rod closing operation.
