# Web Technologies in Use

HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are the main technologies that we use in the web application. Here are the core components that are used in the web application:

* [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) - *A free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.* We use the toolkit of Bootstrap4 including CSS and JavaScript components as the front-end template.
* [Echarts](https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html) - *A powerful charting and visualization library offering an easy way of adding intuitive, interactive, and highly customizable charts.* This library is used in the [user_account.js](../../web_application/user_account.js) to render the chart of statistical data of parking time.

* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - *Simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation.* We use this to manipulate DOM elements and get the element's width and height dynamicaly for rendering Echarts.

* [Paho JavaScript Client](https://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/js/) - *MQTT browser-based client library written in Javascript that uses WebSockets to connect to an MQTT Broker.* Establish connection with broker by this library.
