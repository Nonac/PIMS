# System Implementation
## Breakdown fo project into sprints

This project began in February and officially ended at the end of May. We have set relatively reasonable work assignments and milestones for this purpose. We created the GitHub repository for this project on February 6 and spent a few days after that getting the team familiar with the GitHub operating model. We then comb through the timeline of the different components, reviewing the development of each Sprint.

## Destop App

Sprint 1:
We completed the preliminary design of the entire system prototype between February 24 and February 28. We determined the way MQTT communicated with each component and determined the default form of the data structure within the entire system. Of course, this data form is quite different from the final data structure used, but this prototype has formalized our engineering direction.
