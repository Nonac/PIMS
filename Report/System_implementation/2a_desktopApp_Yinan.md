# System Implementation
## Breakdown fo project into sprints

This project began in February and officially ended at the end of May. We have set relatively reasonable work assignments and milestones for this purpose. We created the GitHub repository for this project on February 6 and spent a few days after that getting the team familiar with the GitHub operating model. We then comb through the timeline of the different components, reviewing the development of each Sprint.

## Destop App

###Sprint 1: Requirements and Design
We completed the preliminary design of the entire system prototype between February 24 and February 28. We determined the way MQTT communicated with each component and determined the default form of the data structure within the entire system. Of course, this data form is quite different from the final data structure used, but this prototype has formalized our engineering direction. Based on determining the system prototype and data structure, we completed the front-end UI sketch design for the desktop app between February 28 and March 5.

###Sprint 2: Desktop App Back-end Develoment
As can be seen from the system design section, the desktop program not only acts as the main body of the desktop program but also acts as a communication bridge between the web and barrier ends. So as a program development back-end needs to be implemented simultaneously with web and m5stack development. The process went relatively smoothly, as our development team was relatively well-staffed, and the back-end developers could meet the design requirements of docking in both directions simultaneously. The back end of the program design was developed from March 19 until April 16 when the docking was completed. Because the desktop app uses object-oriented programming ideas, it can be constructed separately from the development front-end. By the end of development, the back-end app accomplished the following goals.
