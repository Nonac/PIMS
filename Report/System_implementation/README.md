## Social and Ethical implications

#### Data Security, privacy and data protection
Due to the time limitation on this project, the data are currently stored on
local hard disks of the manager who uses the desktop application. Because the 
desktop application is acting as a server, all the data from users will be 
processed by the desktop. This means that users' personal information is not
kept confidential at all at this stage. In the future, after deploying a more
comprehensive database, the users' personal data will not be easily visible
to the managers. In turn, the data should be completely protected and shield
from any visualisation of the employees.

#### Social benefits
With this technology, the time of paying before leaving a parking lot is saved.
More car can park in the lots during busy hours as the cars in the lots can leave
quicker. For the users, they can also easily review and keep track of their parking 
records.

#### Environmental impact
Less emission from cars queuing with their engine on to exit the parking lot.
Less usage of physical currencies at the transactions are payment machines.
Less public facilities to fix: without this system, there will be multiple payment
machines dotted around the parking lot and built inside the exit barriers, 
with this system, there will be no payment machines in the parking lot not 
at the exit. The only publically used facility now will be the M5Stack that
controlls the barriers.

#### Employment
The elimination of public facilities results in less maintenance requirements
thus potentially less employment. However, the higher demand of the keys 
(M5Sticks) will induce more employments for the mass production.
